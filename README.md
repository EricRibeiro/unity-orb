### How to Contribute

We welcome [issues](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-orb/issues) to and [pull requests](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-orb/pulls) against this repository!

### How to Publish An Update (for maintainers)

1. Merge pull requests with desired changes to the main branch.
    - For the best experience, squash-and-merge and use [Conventional Commit Messages](https://conventionalcommits.org/).
2. Find the current version of the orb.
    - You can run `circleci orb info game-ci/unity | grep "Latest"` to see the current version.
3. Create a [new Release](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-orb/releases/new) on GitHub.
    - Click "Choose a tag" and _create_ a new [semantically versioned](http://semver.org/) tag. (ex: v1.0.0)
      - We will have an opportunity to change this before we publish if needed after the next step.
4.  Click _"+ Auto-generate release notes"_.
    - This will create a summary of all of the merged pull requests since the previous release.
    - If you have used _[Conventional Commit Messages](https://conventionalcommits.org/)_ it will be easy to determine what types of changes were made, allowing you to ensure the correct version tag is being published.
5. Now ensure the version tag selected is semantically accurate based on the changes included.
6. Click _"Publish Release"_.
    - This will push a new tag and trigger your publishing pipeline on CircleCI.

### Manual Deploy

If you want a private orb for your build env. The following steps allow you to do so. These are adapted from the CircleCI
[Manual Orb Authoring Process](https://circleci.com/docs/orb-author-validate-publish/#publish-your-orb)

```bash
# Define variables
REPO_URL="git@github.com:game-ci/unity-orb.git" # Change to your fork if needed
BRANCH_NAME="main" # Use desired branch for testing PRs
NAMESPACE="your-username" # Typically your GitHub username; Note: you can only have one namespace per CircleCI org
ORG_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" # Found in CircleCI Organization Settings > Overview page
ORB_NAME="unity-orb-private" # Private Orbs can't become public, so using `-private` allows your_username/unity-orb to be public later

# You should not have to change these variables
SRC_DIR="src"
OUTPUT_FILE="unity-orb.yml"
DEV_VERSION="dev:first"
RELEASE_TYPE="patch"

# Clone the repository
git clone $REPO_URL unity-orb
cd unity-orb || exit

# Checkout the desired branch
git checkout $BRANCH_NAME

# Authenticate with CircleCI
# You will need a token from https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens to continue
circleci setup

# Create a CircleCI namespace
circleci namespace create $NAMESPACE --org-id $ORG_ID

# Create a private Orb under the namespace
# Note: Error: To create private orbs, your organization must enable the 'Allow private orbs' feature in Org Settings > Security.
circleci orb create $NAMESPACE/$ORB_NAME --private

# Pack the Orb configuration from the source directory
circleci orb pack $SRC_DIR > $OUTPUT_FILE

# Publish the packed Orb to a development version
circleci orb publish $OUTPUT_FILE $NAMESPACE/$ORB_NAME@$DEV_VERSION

# Promote the Orb to a stable release version
circleci orb publish promote $NAMESPACE/$ORB_NAME@$DEV_VERSION $RELEASE_TYPE

# You can now use the Orb in your CircleCI configuration
echo "Orb published successfully"

# Retrieve information about the Orb
circleci orb info $NAMESPACE/$ORB_NAME
```
